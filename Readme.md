# Classroom App

This is a semester project for Software Construction and Development. The idea is to develop a mobile which allows the students to join different classrooms and view their timetables. Classrooms and students records are managed through admin panel.

## Mobile App: 
scd_project directory contains a flutter project. Students are suppose to use this app to join courses

## Admin Panel: 
SCDProject-AdminPanel directory contains WPF (Windows Presentation Foundations) project. It is an admin panel which will allow the admin to manage courses, students and their joining requests

## Backend API: 
URSBackend contains ASP.NET Core API which provides the access to database to both Flutter app and Admin panel


### Note
The System was testing under the wifi hotspot due to limitations of resources. The server ip was set to https://192.168.43.164:5001 . The system may 
behave differently when used under different networks and IPs. It is recommended to change the IPs in configuration files and rebuild the project for correct results.
